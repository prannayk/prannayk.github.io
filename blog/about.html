            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This blog is just the daily rantings of yet another college sophomore who thinks he is worth something, a proposition that may or may not attract him. But this is also a blog about ideas, an outlet for the rantings of an active mind, telling people what can be done in ways they may or may not realize they can.</p>
<p>The name of the blog might make you think what the hell is going on. So currying is the thing you do when you take a lot of functions together and string them up one after the other to perform a task functionally. Now this blog is called Alfred for the help it gives me like Alfred did for the Batman. But it is curried in a lot of ideas.</p>
<p># If you still do not understand, I donâ€™t think you should bother tryin more. You never will.</p>
