<p>So let us take this step by step. The first try I did recently was trying to make a blog was using PHP. So for testing one must start an Apache server and then compile everything alongside PHP and then can one start doing something there. So what is there that can go wrong ? EVERYTHING. Let us just make a list shall we 1. Compile errors 2. PHP version conflicts with Apache 3. Writing an entire library that is incompatible with new PHP updates. 4. MySQL backends decide not to work with either the old or the new PHP but require a different build of PHP altogether.</p>
<p>And I was just getting started. So after this I moved onto Ruby on Rails. So now I am a happy guy trying to learn Ruby on Rails and I follow the tutorials to the dot to learn Ruby. Once I do that I find out that one must install a lot of other packages for Rails to work. At this point I was very enthusiastic about Ruby on Rails and with the mid semesters coming up I was working on a timeline. So I start installing required Gems each of which failed. Not only did each fail, they messed up by Ruby build too and I had to unlink Ruby and re-install it with HomeBrew after every attempt. After 3 tries I gave up and shifted to a Ubuntu system. Foolishly, in a moment of weakness I installed Ubuntu 15 on my system which rendered my system prone to unstable builds. So once I did try installing Ruby on this system, this too failed atleast twice. So after wasting 4.5 hours I decided I must install Ubuntu 14 on another partition. Note I was also running Arch and Windows on this given system only. So now I installl Ubuntu 14 only to realize that Windows was blocking my display driver in some weird manner. An error which cited stuff I had not even heard of before and probably will never hear again either.</p>
<p>So the only option I had left was to format my hard disk and install Ubuntu 14 and so I did. 4 hours later I decided to sleep rather than code. The following 2 days I developed on Rails and just as I was forgetting Murphyâ€™s Law, mid semesters came along taking with them not only my time and patience but also forcing me to abandon this project since I had to work on Haskell after the exams.</p>
<p>So exams got over and I decided to work with only functional programming languages after falling in love with them. Once that was done, there was no going back. No rails. No nothing. And since I am still comparitively uninitiated in OS development I was not known to Erlang so I decided to write my own parsers. And you know the rest of the story. But even when I decided to finally work on Hakyll it was not a cakewalk.</p>
<p>The Cabal package manager is probably one of the most worthless things ever built since after 3.5 hours and nearly 5 tries I was not able to install Hakyll. So I shifted to Stack for Haskell which did the job in one go. But Cabal had already messed up my Haskell modules in such a way that they could be fixed only from Cabal and hence I had to spend another hour to set all that up too. It was only 5 hours after my self-set deadline that I successfully set up my work environement. After some basic editing effective use of Functors and a naive shell script that I had with myself one of the most efficient static web page creators ever. Once that was done came the problem of setting up Travis which, due to inescapable frustration, I bypassed with a way stupider script and an hour to have some good dinner.</p>
<p>Now all that was done and I was well rested began the process of learning Erlang and Zotonic. And as I go deeper the more I like and hate Erlang. But I still find Haskell way better. There are so many amazing things I can do with Erlang that do not even exist in Haskell. But as they say, your first love is your true love and that is probably exactly what is happening with me right now.</p>
